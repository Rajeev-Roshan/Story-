        <h3>
The Batman is a 2022 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character Batman. Produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, DC Films, 6th & Idaho, and <br>Dylan Clark Productions, it is a reboot of the Batman film franchise. The film was directed by Matt Reeves, who wrote the screenplay with Peter Craig.<br>It stars Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman alongside Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis, and <br>Colin Farrell. The film sees Batman, who has been fighting crime in Gotham City for two years, uncover corruption while pursuing the Riddler (Dano), a <br>serial killer who targets Gotham's corrupt elite. 

Development began after Ben Affleck was cast as Batman in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) in 2013. Affleck signed on to direct, produce, co-write, and <br>star in The Batman, but had reservations about the project and dropped out. Reeves took over and reworked the story, removing the DCEU connections. He <br>sought to explore Batman's detective side more than previous films, drawing inspiration from the films of Alfred Hitchcock and the New Hollywood era, <br>and comics such as Year One (1987), The Long Halloween (1996–97), and Ego (2000). Pattinson was cast in May 2019, with further casting in late 2019. <br>Filming began in the United Kingdom in January 2020, but was halted in March by the COVID-19 pandemic. It resumed later in the year and concluded in <br>Chicago in March 2021.

After the COVID-19 pandemic caused two delays to its original June 2021 release date, The Batman was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures on <br>March 4, 2022, three days after it premiered at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan. The film was a commercial success, grossing $771 million against a <br>$185–200 million budget, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2022. It received positive reviews from critics with praise for its acting, <br>direction, visual style, musical score, and action sequences, with minor criticisms for the runtime. The Batman was nominated for three awards at the <br>95th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. The film is intended to launch a Batman shared universe, with two sequels planned and two <br>spin-off television series in development for the streaming service Max, which include The Penguin starring Farrell. The first sequel, titled <br>The Batman – Part II, is set for release on October 3, 2025.

<h3>On Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. is murdered by the masked serial killer the Riddler.          
Reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates
the murder alongside the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). Lieutenant James Gordon discovers a
message that the Riddler left for Batman. The following night, the Riddler kills Commissioner Pete Savage 
and leaves another message for Batman. Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive 
in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika Kosolov, at the Iceberg Lounge—a 
nightclub operated by Oswald "The Penguin" Cobblepot, who is crime boss Carmine Falcone's lieutenant. 
While the Penguin pleads ignorance, Batman notices that Annika's roommate Selina Kyle works at the club 
as a waitress. When Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina to the Iceberg Lounge for answers and 
discovers that Savage was on Falcone's payroll like district attorney Gil Colson.

The Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed collar bomb to his neck and sends him to interrupt Mitchell's 
funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the 
bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third—the name of the informant 
who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending Salvatore Maroni's operation—and 
is killed. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. 
They discover that Maroni's operation transferred to Falcone, with many corrupt GCPD officers involved. 
Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money and discovers Annika's corpse in the 
trunk of a car. Batman captures the Penguin after a car chase, but he and Gordon learn that the Penguin is 
not the informant.

Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an orphanage funded by Bruce's deceased parents Thomas and
Martha Wayne, where they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against the Wayne family. Bruce's butler and caretaker
Alfred Pennyworth is hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler leaks evidence that 
Thomas, who was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill a journalist who was writing a story 
about Martha's family history of mental illness. Bruce confronts Alfred, who maintains that Thomas only asked Falcone 
to threaten the journalist into silence; upon learning that Falcone had murdered the journalist instead, Thomas planned 
to turn himself and Falcone over to the police. Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to silence them.

Selina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her father. After learning that Falcone killed Annika for discovering that he was 
the informant, Selina tries to kill him, but Batman and Gordon arrive in time to stop her. Gordon arrests Falcone, but the 
Riddler kills Falcone with a sniper rifle moments later. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton and 
incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital, where he tells Batman he took inspiration from him when targeting the corrupt. Batman 
learns that Nashton has planted car bombs around Gotham and cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect 
Bella Reál. The bombs destroy the seawall around Gotham and flood the city. Nashton's followers attempt to kill Reál, but Batman 
and Selina manage to stop them. In the aftermath, Nashton befriends another inmate,[a] while Selina deems Gotham beyond saving 
and leaves. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in Gotham.</h3>
